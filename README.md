# HumanActivityRecognitionUsingSmartphonesCleaningData
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. This project is a course project for the coursera course *Getting and Cleaning Data Course* (https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning)

The main parts of this project are:
 * an R-script: run_analysis.R. (See section *Script* for more information.)
 * a Code Book: indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
## Script

The script fullfils the following criteria:

 *  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 *  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 *  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 *  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 *  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Data
In this project we use the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set", which can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

To run the provided script, extract the zip archive in the root folder of this project.
